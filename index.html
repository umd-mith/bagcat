      <dd>This bag contains Twitter data for 108,884 tweets that were sent to or from
 William Gibson (@greatdismal). However it is believed that the dataset
 does does not include retweets. At the time of data collection the 
 greatdismal account had tweeted and retweeted 46,350 tweets, but this 
 collection only includes 19,743 sent by greatdismal. The inference here 
 is that the difference are retweets, or missed tweets.
 The data was retrieved using a program that collected tweet identifiers 
 from Twitter's search user interface for the query:  
     from:greatdismal OR to:greatdismal
 A sorted version of this list of identifiers is available in the 
 greatdismal-ids.txt file. The full tweet JSON data for the tweets was then 
 retrieved from Twitter's API using twarc (http://twitter.com/edsu/twarc). 
 This data can be found in greatdismal.json file.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains multiple artifacts for the Occupied Japan 
 Gender, Class and Race project website created in 2003-2004
 by Marlene Mayo, who was a Freeman Foundation Fellow. The website
 was found at http://mith.umd.edu/gcr and was password protected
 do to conerns about copyright.
 The bag was created on June 15, 2015 after an earlier migration from 
 zelda.umd.edu at UMD to Amazon Web Services failed to migrate 
 the website. At that point a snapshot of the website (PHP code, 
 MySQL database and static assets) was created, which you can find 
 as gcr.tar.gz.  At the same time the website was crawled with wget 
 (the command is in get.sh) to both mirror the contents of the website 
 and also create a WARC and CDX web archive. The static mirror of the 
 website can be found in the mith.umd.edu directory. The static site was 
 then put back online at http://mith.umd.edu/gcr on a machine hosted
 on Amazon EC2.</dd>

      <dd>On June 17, 2015 a mass shooting took place at Emanuel African Methodist
 Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Soon afterward the 
 #charleston and #charlestonshooting hashtags were used on Twitter to 
 spread news of the event. On June 18th Bergis Jules of UC Riverside
 and Ed Summers of University of Maryland began collecting #charleston
 and #charlestonshooting tweets as both a historical search and a stream. 
 Both files are included here, and comprise 3,099,173 tweets from 
 June 10 to June 30. The first few hundred of the tweets included #charleston
 tweets prior to the event.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the DISC website code and database taken on May 20, 2015
 by Porter Olsen. The DISC website was retired because of concerns over 
 security vulnerabilities in the code in 2006. The physical hardware that 
 served the MITH website at that time (minerva.umd.edu) was preserved at that 
 time. Porter Olsen was able to locate the server code and database in 2015.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the /export/software directory on zelda.umd.edu on August
 18, 2015 when it was finally decommissioned (turned off). Previously zelda was 
 the host that made many MITH web properties available. The websites were
 largely moved over to Amazon Web Services in December of 2014. But zelda was 
 left on for 8 months while we transitioned some last remaining DNS names that
 were pointed at zelda. /export/software contains all the database and website
 content. It is in a tarball, which has not preserved timestamps and usernames
 unfortunately. For that there is going to be a forensic snapshot of zelda which
 should be made available as a separate bag. This bag is meant to be a
 convenience to get data that is needed after zelda is taken offline, without
 requiring remounting disk images.</dd>

      <dd>These are tweets from @TriciaLockwood that were scraped from Twitter's search on September 29, 2015. The query
 @TriciaLockwood was used, which will include any tweet sent by or to
 her, as well as any tweets that mention her handle in the text of the tweet.
 It is important to remember that Twitter's search does not include retweets. 
 So you will not find @TriciaLockwood's retweets in this dataset. 
 There are 49,573 tweets in JSON format, and at the time she was listed as 
 having 12,438 tweets. The scraping process was a PhantomJS script that 
 exercised the infinite scroll in search results, and extracted the tweet 
 ids. The tweet ids were then hydrated using the twarc tool.</dd>

 University of Maryland on February 25, 2002. The original website at
 http://mith.umd.edu/hughes/ became unavailable, possibly as early as 2003.
 In May 2015 Porter Olsen recovered the website from an old webserver named 
 Minerva. When the website was put back online the original QuickTime videos 
 of the event were converted to mp4 for accessibility reasons. The original
 QuickTime files were left in place, along with what appeared to be editor 
 backup files with a tilde extension.</dd>

    a 15 year old highschool student in Redondo Beach High School who 
    was responding to controversial statements made by Presidential
    candidate Jeb Bush. This story in the LA Times talked about how the
    tweet trended that night.

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the MITH Forensics Workshop website generated on 
 February 14, 2016 using wget. The included files are:
 - forensics.sql.gz: a database dump of the WordPress site
 - mith.umd.edu-forensics.tar.gz: a snapshot of the WordPress installation
 - mith.umd.edu.tar.gz: a static site generated with wget
 - forensics.warc.gz: a web archive file generated with wget
 On testing the website it was discovered that the live site had a broken
 link for the Stephen Eniss' audio presentation. The correct link was
 deteremined by looking on the filesystem and noticing that the link
 contained a typo. It was difficult to fix the link in the WordPress
 site since it wasn't completely operational. So the link was fixed
 in the static representation that was mounted on the Web.</dd>

      <dd>This is a collection of tweets using the #SayHerName hashtag.
 It includes 188,146 tweets for the period of November 6, 2010 to 
 May 27, 2015 that were collected with the twarc tool. The dataset is 
 made up of three different gzipped files of tweets: scraped.json.gz, 
 search.json.gz and stream.json.gz.
 search.json.gz was collected from the search API starting on May 22, 2015.
 At the same time data collection fromt the streaming API was started and 
 captured as stream.json.gz. The scraped.json.gz file contains tweets 
 that were scraped from Twitter's search UI for the period prior to where 
 search.json.gz left off. These tweet ids were then rehydrated using twarc. 
 It is important to note that the scraped tweets did not seem to include
 retweets. While the JSON is similar in structure, the coverage is quite
 different from search.json.gz and stream.json.gz.
 The #SayHerName report was released on May 20, 2015 by the African American 
 Policy Forum and the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at
 Columbia University as well as Andrea Ritchie, Soros Justice Fellow.  More 
 about the use of this hashtag can be read at 
 http://www.aapf.org/sayhernamereport/ The tweets were collected as

      <dd>This bag contains 32,056 tweets that mention "ferguson" between 
 August 8 and August 10, 2014. They were collected on May 7th, 2015
 using a script that collected Twitter identifiers from the search
 form on Twitter's website:
     https://github.com/edsu/twarc/blob/master/utils/discover_ids.py
 The identifiers were then rehydrated using twarc's --hydrate option.
 Some important ramifications to be aware of is that the dataset does
 not include tweets that were deleted before May 7th, 2015 ; and retweets
 are not included.
 This datset augments another tweet collection (mith-bag 
 fe28a093-d3f4-42d7-83ba-f5ba1b1cc765) which has a more complete snapshot
 but is missing tweets just after the killing of Michael Brown on 
 August 9th.</dd>

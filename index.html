      <dd>This bag contains Twitter data for 108,884 tweets that were sent to or from
 William Gibson (@greatdismal). However it is believed that the dataset
 does does not include retweets. At the time of data collection the 
 greatdismal account had tweeted and retweeted 46,350 tweets, but this 
 collection only includes 19,743 sent by greatdismal. The inference here 
 is that the difference are retweets, or missed tweets.
 The data was retrieved using a program that collected tweet identifiers 
 from Twitter's search user interface for the query:  
     from:greatdismal OR to:greatdismal
 A sorted version of this list of identifiers is available in the 
 greatdismal-ids.txt file. The full tweet JSON data for the tweets was then 
 retrieved from Twitter's API using twarc (http://twitter.com/edsu/twarc). 
 This data can be found in greatdismal.json file.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains multiple artifacts for the Occupied Japan 
 Gender, Class and Race project website created in 2003-2004
 by Marlene Mayo, who was a Freeman Foundation Fellow. The website
 was found at http://mith.umd.edu/gcr and was password protected
 do to conerns about copyright.
 The bag was created on June 15, 2015 after an earlier migration from 
 zelda.umd.edu at UMD to Amazon Web Services failed to migrate 
 the website. At that point a snapshot of the website (PHP code, 
 MySQL database and static assets) was created, which you can find 
 as gcr.tar.gz.  At the same time the website was crawled with wget 
 (the command is in get.sh) to both mirror the contents of the website 
 and also create a WARC and CDX web archive. The static mirror of the 
 website can be found in the mith.umd.edu directory. The static site was 
 then put back online at http://mith.umd.edu/gcr on a machine hosted
 on Amazon EC2.</dd>

      <dd>On June 17, 2015 a mass shooting took place at Emanuel African Methodist
 Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Soon afterward the 
 #charleston and #charlestonshooting hashtags were used on Twitter to 
 spread news of the event. On June 18th Bergis Jules of UC Riverside
 and Ed Summers of University of Maryland began collecting #charleston
 and #charlestonshooting tweets as both a historical search and a stream. 
 Both files are included here, and comprise 3,099,173 tweets from 
 June 10 to June 30. The first few hundred of the tweets included #charleston
 tweets prior to the event.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the DISC website code and database taken on May 20, 2015
 by Porter Olsen. The DISC website was retired because of concerns over 
 security vulnerabilities in the code in 2006. The physical hardware that 
 served the MITH website at that time (minerva.umd.edu) was preserved at that 
 time. Porter Olsen was able to locate the server code and database in 2015.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the /export/software directory on zelda.umd.edu on August
 18, 2015 when it was finally decommissioned (turned off). Previously zelda was 
 the host that made many MITH web properties available. The websites were
 largely moved over to Amazon Web Services in December of 2014. But zelda was 
 left on for 8 months while we transitioned some last remaining DNS names that
 were pointed at zelda. /export/software contains all the database and website
 content. It is in a tarball, which has not preserved timestamps and usernames
 unfortunately. For that there is going to be a forensic snapshot of zelda which
 should be made available as a separate bag. This bag is meant to be a
 convenience to get data that is needed after zelda is taken offline, without
 requiring remounting disk images.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains two datasets of tweets that were collected for "hillary" and
 "trump" from October 9, 2016 9:00 EDT to October 9, 2016 10:30 EDT. This time
 period covers the duration of their second debate at Washington University in
 St Louis. The "trump" dataset includes 327,751 tweets and the "hillary"
 dataset includes 337,320 tweets.  According to the logs at least 1,208,536 and
 419,544 tweets for the trump and hillary datasets were not delivered due to
 throttling of the data by Twitter.  The datasets were collected using two
 separate twarc processes that were running on the same m4.xlarge Amazon EC2
 instance using different sets of Twitter developer keys. Included in the
 payload directory are the scripts that were used to start the data collection,
 their respective log files and the data files themselves.</dd>

      <dd>These are tweets from @TriciaLockwood that were scraped from Twitter's search on September 29, 2015. The query
 @TriciaLockwood was used, which will include any tweet sent by or to
 her, as well as any tweets that mention her handle in the text of the tweet.
 It is important to remember that Twitter's search does not include retweets. 
 So you will not find @TriciaLockwood's retweets in this dataset. 
 There are 49,573 tweets in JSON format, and at the time she was listed as 
 having 12,438 tweets. The scraping process was a PhantomJS script that 
 exercised the infinite scroll in search results, and extracted the tweet 
 ids. The tweet ids were then hydrated using the twarc tool.</dd>

      <dd>The shooting of Korryn Gaines occurred on August 1, 2016, in Randallstown,
 Maryland, near Baltimore, resulting in the death of Gaines, a 23-year-old
 African-American woman, and the shooting of her son. According to the
 Baltimore County Police Department, officers sought to serve Gaines a warrant
 in relation to an earlier traffic violation. Upon entering her apartment, an
 hours-long standoff ensued, ending when Gaines threatened police officers
 with her shotgun. At least one of the officers shot Gaines, killing her and
 wounding Gaines' five-year-old son. Portions of the standoff were filmed
 by Gaines and posted to social-media networking sites; however, upon police
 request, Facebook deactivated Gaines' Facebook and Instagram accounts,
 leading to criticisms of the company's involvement in the incident.
 This bag contains 705,974 tweets from the streaming and search API that used 
 the #KorrynGaines hashtag between August 1 and August 9.</dd>

    - Sep 04 19:50:26 2015. The hashtag was first used by Jason Fong,

    tweet trended that night.

      <dd>Data collected from the Twitter filter stream for #blm,#blacklivesmatter 
 between 2016-01-29 and 2017-03-18 using twarc. It includes 13,732,829
 tweets. The files are broken into segments because of network connectivity
 problems, so there are varying time gaps present between the files. Also
 when the hashtags were trending globally rate limits may have prevented some
 tweets from being streamed over the API. Data collection stopped on
 2017-03-18 because of an authentication error that was the result of the
 keys having changed.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the MITH Forensics Workshop website generated on 
 February 14, 2016 using wget. The included files are:
 - forensics.sql.gz: a database dump of the WordPress site
 - mith.umd.edu-forensics.tar.gz: a snapshot of the WordPress installation
 - mith.umd.edu.tar.gz: a static site generated with wget
 - forensics.warc.gz: a web archive file generated with wget
 On testing the website it was discovered that the live site had a broken
 link for the Stephen Eniss' audio presentation. The correct link was
 deteremined by looking on the filesystem and noticing that the link
 contained a typo. It was difficult to fix the link in the WordPress
 site since it wasn't completely operational. So the link was fixed
 in the static representation that was mounted on the Web.</dd>

      <dd>This is a collection of tweets using the #SayHerName hashtag.
 It includes 188,146 tweets for the period of November 6, 2010 to 
 May 27, 2015 that were collected with the twarc tool. The dataset is 
 made up of three different gzipped files of tweets: scraped.json.gz, 
 search.json.gz and stream.json.gz.
 search.json.gz was collected from the search API starting on May 22, 2015.
 At the same time data collection fromt the streaming API was started and 
 captured as stream.json.gz. The scraped.json.gz file contains tweets 
 that were scraped from Twitter's search UI for the period prior to where 
 search.json.gz left off. These tweet ids were then rehydrated using twarc. 
 It is important to note that the scraped tweets did not seem to include
 retweets. While the JSON is similar in structure, the coverage is quite
 different from search.json.gz and stream.json.gz.
 The #SayHerName report was released on May 20, 2015 by the African American 
 Policy Forum and the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at
 Columbia University as well as Andrea Ritchie, Soros Justice Fellow.  More 
 about the use of this hashtag can be read at 
 http://www.aapf.org/sayhernamereport/ The tweets were collected as 
 part of a collaboration between MITH at the University of Maryland
 and the University Archives at the University of California at Riverside.</dd>

 collected from the search API. The separate search files are the result
 of Internal Server errors from Twitter's search API which resulted in
 a search needing to be started again.</dd>

 research study conducted by Deen Freelon, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D.
 Clark in February of 2016. Their report, which includes details about how this
 dataset was assembled, is included as a PDF, and more information about the
 dataaset can also be found at

      <dd>These are files collected from the NEH Funded Projects database for the
 Office of Digital Humanities
 https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/Faq.aspx
 They were collected when it was announced that the Trump administration
 wanted to defund the NEH
 http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts
 MITH was able to obtain a spreadsheet (Muffin Files.xlsx) which contains
 the identifiers for each funded project. A program (download.py) was written 
 that downloads the PDF and Excel file for each project and puts it in the
 white-papers directory. In addition a file data.csv is included which is
 the combination of all the Excel files as a CSV.</dd>

      <dd>This is a collection of tweets related to the 2016 US presidential election, 
 collected over the period of July 13, 2016 to November 10, 2016 by George
 Washington University. GWU made the collection available as a tweet 
 identifier dataset, which was then hydrated at the University of Maryland
 over the period of December 1, 2016 and January 2, 2017 using the twarc
 utility.
 The original dataset contained 270,189,978 unique twitter identifiers of which 
 237,651,319 were hydrated (88%). This bag contains the ids that were used 
 for hydration in the ids directory, and the hydrated tweets in the tweets
 directory. Each id file has a corresponding README that explains how the 
 dataset was created, including what keywords were used to created it.

      <dd>This bag contains 32,056 tweets that mention "ferguson" between 
 August 8 and August 10, 2014. They were collected on May 7th, 2015
 using a script that collected Twitter identifiers from the search
 form on Twitter's website:
     https://github.com/edsu/twarc/blob/master/utils/discover_ids.py
 The identifiers were then rehydrated using twarc's --hydrate option.
 Some important ramifications to be aware of is that the dataset does
 not include tweets that were deleted before May 7th, 2015 ; and retweets
 are not included.
 This datset augments another tweet collection (mith-bag 
 fe28a093-d3f4-42d7-83ba-f5ba1b1cc765) which has a more complete snapshot
 but is missing tweets just after the killing of Michael Brown on 
 August 9th.</dd>

 2015-07-08 and 2017-03-18. The tweets were collected with Social Feed Manager
 (m5_003). The directory path that SFM stored twitter data was archived and
 compressed as data/tweets.tar.gz.
 You will notice on unarchiving that that the archive includes many individual
 tweet files organized by year, month, day, hour. Each file usually contains
 15 minutes of tweets. These files are usuall gzip compressed but you will
 notice that there are a few that are not. You will also notice that a small
 number of files were not close correctly so you get an error like 
 "unexpected end of file" on reading the end of the file.</dd>

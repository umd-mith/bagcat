      <dd>This bag contains Twitter data for 108,884 tweets that were sent to or from
 William Gibson (@greatdismal). However it is believed that the dataset
 does does not include retweets. At the time of data collection the 
 greatdismal account had tweeted and retweeted 46,350 tweets, but this 
 collection only includes 19,743 sent by greatdismal. The inference here 
 is that the difference are retweets, or missed tweets.
 The data was retrieved using a program that collected tweet identifiers 
 from Twitter's search user interface for the query:  
     from:greatdismal OR to:greatdismal
 A sorted version of this list of identifiers is available in the 
 greatdismal-ids.txt file. The full tweet JSON data for the tweets was then 
 retrieved from Twitter's API using twarc (http://twitter.com/edsu/twarc). 
 This data can be found in greatdismal.json file.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains multiple artifacts for the Occupied Japan 
 Gender, Class and Race project website created in 2003-2004
 by Marlene Mayo, who was a Freeman Foundation Fellow. The website
 was found at http://mith.umd.edu/gcr and was password protected
 do to conerns about copyright.
 The bag was created on June 15, 2015 after an earlier migration from 
 zelda.umd.edu at UMD to Amazon Web Services failed to migrate 
 the website. At that point a snapshot of the website (PHP code, 
 MySQL database and static assets) was created, which you can find 
 as gcr.tar.gz.  At the same time the website was crawled with wget 
 (the command is in get.sh) to both mirror the contents of the website 
 and also create a WARC and CDX web archive. The static mirror of the 
 website can be found in the mith.umd.edu directory. The static site was 
 then put back online at http://mith.umd.edu/gcr on a machine hosted
 on Amazon EC2.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains tweets collected by Ed Summers in collaboration with Vernon
 Mitchell, Cassie Adcock, and AJ Robinson (WUSTL). They document the resistance
 to efforts by the Hindu Right in India to deprive Muslim Indians from
 citizenship. Data collection from the Twitter filter stream began on December
 25, 2019 and ended on January 21 after collecting 14,144,417 tweets. In addition 
 on Decemebr 25, 2019 data was collected from the Twitter search API collecting 
 5,345,453 tweets back to December 20, 2019. In total 19,489,870 were collected
 and their tweet ids are are stored in sorted order in the ids.txt.gz file. In
 addition the twarc commands that were used to run the data collection can be 
 found in the search.sh and stream.sh scripts in the data directory. 
 Below is the email from Cassie sent on December 24, 2019 which outlined the
 rationale for what was collected:

 Thank you, Ed and Vernon. I'm also including AJ Robinson on this message,
 since she expressed interest in this archiving project.
 I'm primarily thinking of creating a dataset for future researchers.  This is
 a major political event, in which the Hindu Right, which has been steadily
 rising over recent decades, finally confronts massive popular resistance in its
 effort to impose its vision of a Hindu Nation by depriving Muslim Indians of
 citizenship.  The resistance is India-wide, and includes  a wide base of social
 groups.  This is also a major turning point, because we finally see the Hindu
 Nationalist government in power directing police forces to direct unwarranted
 brutality and violence on Muslim Indians all across the country.   On both
 counts, we have seen this before, but localized in particular cities or states,
 not India-wide.
 I have zero tech skills of this kind so I would be grateful to see some
 preliminary archive underway. The core tags seem to be: 
 #CAA
 #CAAProtests
 #CAB
 #CABProtests
 #NRC
 #JamiaMilia
 #JamiaProtest
 And variations –
 #NoToCAB
 #NoToNRC
 #CitizenshipAmendmentAct
 #CAA_NRC_Protests
 #IndiaAgainstCAA_NRC
 I'm less concerned to archive the propaganda-mongering of the Hindu Right, but those tags are:
 #isupportCAB
 #IsupportCAB2019
 #ISupportCAA_NRC
 #ISupportCAA</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains the Omeka server side code and database snapshot for
 the Internet Research Agency Ads website that was created by Damien
 Pfister in collaboration with Ed Summers and Purdom Lindblad of MITH.
 The bag also contains a wget crawl of https://mith.umd.edu/irads/ which
 is persisted as a static site and a WARC file.
 File listing:
 irads.sql.gz - Omeka MySQL database dump
 mith-irads.tar.gz - Omeka server side PHP code
 irads.warc.gz - WARC file generated by wget crawl
 mith.umd.edu.tar.gz - static site created with wget crawl
 The site description at the time of archiving was as follows:
 This site explores--and offers users the opportunity to explore--the rhetoric
 of computational propaganda that occurred on Facebook during the 2016 election.
 The project was developed by Dr. Damien Smith Pfister, Nora Murphy, Meridith
 Styer, and Misti Yang in collaboration with Purdom Lindblad and Ed Summers at
 the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities. 160 students from the
 "Interpreting Strategic Discourse" classes offered by the University of
 Maryland's Department of Communication coded the dataset by hand.
 The IRAdS website contains over 3,000 Facebook advertisements that the Internet
 Research Agency, a Russia-linked “troll farm,” purchased in the run-up to the
 2016 election campaign. This is one of the most sophisticated efforts at
 computational propaganda yet, but little systematic analysis has been done on
 this data corpus.
 Pfister, Murphy, and Yang developed the codebook based on concepts developed in
 the class (e.g. metaphors, myths, ideographs, semiotics; syllabus available
 here). Our hope is that this dataset will surface and organize different themes
 across these advertisements. In collaboration with MITH, these advertisements
 will be posted, with our analysis embedded as metadata, on a website that other
 publics can use to better understand Russia’s propaganda efforts.</dd>

      <dd>On June 17, 2015 a mass shooting took place at Emanuel African Methodist
 Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Soon afterward the 
 #charleston and #charlestonshooting hashtags were used on Twitter to 
 spread news of the event. On June 18th Bergis Jules of UC Riverside
 and Ed Summers of University of Maryland began collecting #charleston
 and #charlestonshooting tweets as both a historical search and a stream. 
 Both files are included here, and comprise 3,099,173 tweets from 
 June 10 to June 30. The first few hundred of the tweets included #charleston
 tweets prior to the event.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains a wget capture of the https://archive.blackgothamarchive.org/
 Omeka website on July 10, 2018 in order to decommission the Omeka website
 that was several versions behind, and hadn't been updated in 4 years but
 still contains a useful collection of materials. The static version of the 
 website was mounted in place of the Omeka site, and the server side PHP
 and database were placed into this bag. The wget capture was executed with 
 the bagweb utility https://github.com/edsu/bagweb/
 The Omeka instance couldn't be upgraded to the latest version of Omeka
 because its theme was not compatible. This meant that PHP could not be updated 
 past v5.6, and security patches couldn't be installed. If you want to  
 bring the Omeka site back online you will need to use PHP v5.6. This
 apt-get install command should pull in the necessary modules: 
   sudo apt-get install php5.6 php5.6-mbstring php5.6-xml php5.6-mysql \
     php5.6-common php5.6-gd php5.6-json php5.6-cli php5.6-curl
 You will also need to enable mod_rewrite in Apache:
   sudo a2enmod rewrite</dd>

      <dd>463,956 tweets collected between 2016-01-29 and 2016-10-14 that used the
 hashtag #SayHerName. During this time #SayHerName was a social movement that
 raised awareness for black female victims of police brutality and anti-Black
 violence in the United States. The tweets were collected as part of a
 collaborative research project between MITH and the Sociology Department at
 the University of Maryland. The results of analyzing the data were published
 in this paper: Brown, M., Ray, R., Summers, E. & Fraistat, N. (2017)
 #SayHerName: a case study of intersectional social media activism. Ethnic and
 Racial Studies, 40(11), 1831-1846.

 The bag contains four files, one of which was collected from Twitter's Search
 API and the other three were collected from the Streaming API. The reason for
 the seaprate streaming API files is that there was network connectivity
 problems that went unnoticed for some period of time that resulted in two gaps.
 The first gap occurs on March 19, 2016 and extends to April 22, 2016. The
 second gap starts on June 26, 2016 and goes till July 6, 2016. The twarc.log
 file was created by the twarc utility as it was collecting data from the 
 Twitter APIs.
 On January 2, 2017 the stream4.json.gz file was updated to remove a partial
 JSON object in the last line of stream4.json.gz which was caused by 
 the forced termination of the stream. This description was also updated with
 information based on use of the data by Trevor Muñoz for a presentation at MLA
 2018.</dd>

      <dd>The African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities conference was 
 held at the University of Maryland at College Park between October 18-20,
 2018. Because of MITH's involvement in the project the tweets containing
 the hashtags #aadhum2018 and #aadhum18 were collected using the twarc
 utility on October 22. The search retrieved 7,226 tweets back to October 11. 
 Since there were many tweets in response threads that did not have the 
 hashtag, the twarc replies.py utility was used to collect conversation 
 threads that hung off of the originally collected tags. This generated 
 an additional 738 tweets, which are included along with all the originally
 collected tweets search-replies.jsonl.gz.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the /export/software directory on zelda.umd.edu on August
 18, 2015 when it was finally decommissioned (turned off). Previously zelda was 
 the host that made many MITH web properties available. The websites were
 largely moved over to Amazon Web Services in December of 2014. But zelda was 
 left on for 8 months while we transitioned some last remaining DNS names that
 were pointed at zelda. /export/software contains all the database and website
 content. It is in a tarball, which has not preserved timestamps and usernames
 unfortunately. For that there is going to be a forensic snapshot of zelda which
 should be made available as a separate bag. This bag is meant to be a
 convenience to get data that is needed after zelda is taken offline, without
 requiring remounting disk images.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains two datasets of tweets that were collected for "hillary" and
 "trump" from October 9, 2016 9:00 EDT to October 9, 2016 10:30 EDT. This time
 period covers the duration of their second debate at Washington University in
 St Louis. The "trump" dataset includes 327,751 tweets and the "hillary"
 dataset includes 337,320 tweets.  According to the logs at least 1,208,536 and
 419,544 tweets for the trump and hillary datasets were not delivered due to
 throttling of the data by Twitter.  The datasets were collected using two
 separate twarc processes that were running on the same m4.xlarge Amazon EC2
 instance using different sets of Twitter developer keys. Included in the
 payload directory are the scripts that were used to start the data collection,
 their respective log files and the data files themselves.</dd>

      <dd>These are tweets from @TriciaLockwood that were scraped from Twitter's search on September 29, 2015. The query
 @TriciaLockwood was used, which will include any tweet sent by or to
 her, as well as any tweets that mention her handle in the text of the tweet.
 It is important to remember that Twitter's search does not include retweets. 
 So you will not find @TriciaLockwood's retweets in this dataset. 
 There are 49,573 tweets in JSON format, and at the time she was listed as 
 having 12,438 tweets. The scraping process was a PhantomJS script that 
 exercised the infinite scroll in search results, and extracted the tweet 
 ids. The tweet ids were then hydrated using the twarc tool.</dd>

      <dd>The shooting of Korryn Gaines occurred on August 1, 2016, in Randallstown,
 Maryland, near Baltimore, resulting in the death of Gaines, a 23-year-old
 African-American woman, and the shooting of her son. According to the
 Baltimore County Police Department, officers sought to serve Gaines a warrant
 in relation to an earlier traffic violation. Upon entering her apartment, an
 hours-long standoff ensued, ending when Gaines threatened police officers
 with her shotgun. At least one of the officers shot Gaines, killing her and
 wounding Gaines' five-year-old son. Portions of the standoff were filmed
 by Gaines and posted to social-media networking sites; however, upon police
 request, Facebook deactivated Gaines' Facebook and Instagram accounts,
 leading to criticisms of the company's involvement in the incident.
 This bag contains 705,974 tweets from the streaming and search API that used 
 the #KorrynGaines hashtag between August 1 and August 9.</dd>

      <dd>20,729 #MyAsianAmerican tweets collected between Aug 25 02:24:10 UTC and
    - Sep 04 19:50:26 2015. The hashtag was first used by Jason Fong, 
    a 15 year old highschool student in Redondo Beach High School who 
    was responding to controversial statements made by Presidential
    candidate Jeb Bush. This story in the LA Times talked about how the
    tweet trended that night.

      <dd>Data collected from the Twitter filter stream for #blm,#blacklivesmatter 
 between 2016-01-29 and 2017-03-18 using twarc. It includes 17,292,130
 tweets. The files are broken into segments because of network connectivity
 problems, so there are varying time gaps present between the files. Also
 when the hashtags were trending globally rate limits may have prevented some
 tweets from being streamed over the API. Data collection stopped on
 2017-03-18 because of an authentication error that was the result of the
 keys having changed. On October 6, 2017 during some data processing of 
 the files it was discovered that due to gzip encoding errors in 
 stream3.json.gz and stream5.json.gz the total count had been undercounted 
 at 13,732,829. The encoding was fixed and the fixities in the manifests were 
 updated.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains two datasets of tweets that were collected for "hillary" 
 and "trump" from September 26, 2016 22:00 GMT to September 27, 2016 08:00. 
 This time period covers the duration of their first debate at Hofstra
 University, which started at 9pm EDT and lasted 95 minutes. The "trump"
 dataset includes 1,636,098 tweets and the "hillary" dataset includes 
 1,303,084 tweets. According to the logs at least 2,059,946 and 730,512 tweets
 for the trump and hillary datasets were not delivered due to throttling of 
 the data by Twitter. The datasets were collected using two separate twarc 
 processes that were running on the same m4.xlarge Amazon EC2 instance using 
 different sets of Twitter developer keys. Included in the payload directory 
 are the scripts that were used to start the data collection, their respective 
 log files and the data files themselves.</dd>

      <dd>This is a snapshot of the MITH Forensics Workshop website generated on 
 February 14, 2016 using wget. The included files are:
 - forensics.sql.gz: a database dump of the WordPress site
 - mith.umd.edu-forensics.tar.gz: a snapshot of the WordPress installation
 - mith.umd.edu.tar.gz: a static site generated with wget
 - forensics.warc.gz: a web archive file generated with wget
 On testing the website it was discovered that the live site had a broken
 link for the Stephen Eniss' audio presentation. The correct link was
 deteremined by looking on the filesystem and noticing that the link
 contained a typo. It was difficult to fix the link in the WordPress
 site since it wasn't completely operational. So the link was fixed
 in the static representation that was mounted on the Web.</dd>

 Website that was held at the University of Maryland in May of 2017. The
 conference website lived at https://mith.umd.edu/sts2017. The website was
 archived because the conference has passed, and the contents are no longer
 going to change. The bag contains a WARC file that was generated during the
 crawl. The static site that was created needed to be modified slightly to get
 the page header to work correctly. Since the website was part of MITH's 
 multisite installation of Wordpress there was no distinct database or
 files to archive in addition to the snapshot.</dd>

      <dd>The 2017 solar eclipse occurred on August 21 and and was total for Oregon,
 Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee,
 North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina. This bag includes 13,548,321
 tweets that included any of the keywords solareclipse2017, solareclipse,
 eclipse2017, eclipseday or eclipse for the period August 17 to August 23,
 2017. The hashtags were were selected after watching Twitter's streaming API
 for the trending hashtag #solareclipse2017 and counting the most popular
 co-occurring hashtags. Since data collection via the search API was unlikely
 to finish within the 7 day window that search results are available, two
 separate searches were run with twarc starting on August 23. The first
 (search.jsonl.gz) included tweets that happened since tweet id
 899673005755858944. The second (search-maxid.jsonl.gz) includes searches that
 happened prior to 899673005755858944. The search API was used instead of
 the streaming API because the streaming API was emitting notifications that 
 many tweets were not delivered, because the volume was so high.</dd>

      <dd>This is a collection of tweets using the #SayHerName hashtag.
 It includes 188,146 tweets for the period of November 6, 2010 to 
 May 27, 2015 that were collected with the twarc tool. The dataset is 
 made up of three different gzipped files of tweets: scraped.json.gz, 
 search.json.gz and stream.json.gz.
 search.json.gz was collected from the search API starting on May 22, 2015.
 At the same time data collection fromt the streaming API was started and 
 captured as stream.json.gz. The scraped.json.gz file contains tweets 
 that were scraped from Twitter's search UI for the period prior to where 
 search.json.gz left off. These tweet ids were then rehydrated using twarc. 
 It is important to note that the scraped tweets did not seem to include
 retweets. While the JSON is similar in structure, the coverage is quite
 different from search.json.gz and stream.json.gz.
 The #SayHerName report was released on May 20, 2015 by the African American 
 Policy Forum and the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at
 Columbia University as well as Andrea Ritchie, Soros Justice Fellow.  More 
 about the use of this hashtag can be read at 
 http://www.aapf.org/sayhernamereport/ The tweets were collected as 
 part of a collaboration between MITH at the University of Maryland
 and the University Archives at the University of California at Riverside.</dd>

      <dd>This bag includes datasets that were created with the docnow prototype that
 ran during 2016-2017 at http://app.docnow.io. These datasets were created
 by Bergis Jules (co-pi) and shared via the DocNow Catalog application as 
 tweet identifier datasets. The underlying JSON data was transferred from UMD's
 Amazon Web Services EC2 instance where the prototype application was running
 to Washington University in St Louis in April, 2018 after the conclusion of
 the initial phase of work on Documenting the Now grant from the Mellon 
 Foundation.
 Each dataset is listed below which includes the search query that was used, 
 the time it was created, the number of tweets, and the path to filename. 
 The data was collected from the Twitter Search API which provided access 
 to the last 10 days of tweets from the time of the search.

      <dd>This bag contains data from the Foreign Languages in America project that
 was collected by Peter Mallios of the University of Maryland and given
 to MITH in May of 2015. The original data consisted of two Box folders 
 which contained TIFF, JPEG, DJVU, OCR and Excel files for image scans that 
 were collected by the FLA team. This data was normalized into a single 
 directory structure for use in a static Jekyll website. The software for
 doing the normalization is available at:

 October 5, 2017 that mentioned #CatalanReferendum, #CatalalonianReferendum,
 #Catalonia, #1oct, #1o or #votarem. These were hashtags used in the lead up
 to the Catalan Independence Referendum on October 1, 2017. The referendum was
 declared illegal under Spanish law, and the Spanish police were ordered to
 prevent it. The hashtags were selected after monitoring the
 #CatalanReferendum hashtag for several hours on September 28 to determine
 what the top hashtags were. The tweets themselves were collected from the
 Twitter Search API using twarc and its twarc-archive utility. twarc-archive
 was run every hour to collect the tweets that occurred since the last run.
 The data collection was a collaboration with Vicenç Ruiz Gómez and Aniol
 Maria of the Society of Catalan Archivists working in conjunction with Ed
 Summers of MITH.</dd>

      <dd>The 1619 Project was developed by The New York Times Magazine in 2019 with
 the goal of re-examining the legacy of slavery in the United States and timed
 for the 400th anniversary of the arrival in America of the first enslaved
 people from West Africa. It is an interactive project by Nikole Hannah-Jones,
 a reporter for The New York Times, with contributions by the paper's writers,
 including essays, poems, short fiction, and a photo essay.[1] Originally
 conceived of as a special issue for August 20, 2019, it was soon turned into
 a full-fledged project, including a special broadsheet section in the
 newspaper, live events, and a multi-episode podcast series. (from Wikipedia)
 This bag contains metadata for tweets related to the hashtag #1619project.
 They were collected on January 8, 2020 using twint and the keyword
 1619project.
 twint -s '1619project' --csv --output twint.csv
 twint scrapes Twitter's search results and writes the results as CSV. The
 tweet identifiers were extracted from this CSV and included as the ids.txt
 file. On January 19, 2020 the ids.txt was hydrated as tweets.jsonl using the
 twarc tool. This explains the discrepancy of 443 tweets that were deleted
 between January 8 and January 19.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains the Omeka installation and database snapshot for the
 lakeland.umd.edu website that was obtained from the jarvis.umd.ed Glue 
 host at UMD. The files were copied from 
 /afs/glue.umd.edu/department/oit/aett/otal/server/omeka/lakeland using
 rsync. The resulting directory was then archived and compressed with tar
 as lakeland.tar.gz. The Omeka database was configured to talk to a MySQL 
 data named omkealakeland. This database was exported with mysqldump and 
 compressed as omkealakeland.sql.gz
 The files were obtained as part of a collaboration with Mary Sies of American 
 Studies to put the Lakeland Digital Archive on a firmer footing. Due to staff 
 turnover system level access to jarvis had been lost by Mary's team over the 
 years. Thanks to input from former UMD employee Jill Reese and the help of 
 UMD DIT I was able to get ssh access and locate the filed and database. See 
 this issue ticket for more context: https://umd.service-now.com/itsc?sys_id=7a03b7fe0f94070c7f232ca8b1050e3f&view=sp&id=ticket&table=incident</dd>

 read about at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5100460.v2
 The tweet ids were hydrated between June 15 and July 2, 2018 
 using the twarc utility. Only 86,062,113 tweets were hydrated
 which is a 42.5% deletion rate. The payload directory includes
 a hydrate.sh script that was used to do the hydration, as well
 as the README that was distributed with the original dataset.
 Finally the wayback directory contains a script to examine 
 links to webarchives in the hydrated JSON data.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains data dropped off by UMD faculty member Mary Sies for the
 Lakeland Community Heritage Project which she directs. On August 16, 2017 she
 dropped off a set of DVDs and a hard drive at MITH. Stephanie Sapienza spoke
 to Mary about what was contained on the DVDs and the hard drives, and then
 copied them to an external hard disk. The hard disk was then mirrored to
 Google Drive. In addition they were tarred up and gzipped by Ed Summers to
 preserve timestamps and compress the data. The goal was to allow the other
 copies to be manipulated while keeping a copy of what was delivered to MITH
 for preservation purposes. The two tarballs that are present in the data
 payload directory of the bag are the result of that archiving. From
 Stephanie's conversation with Mary It is believed that the media were used by
 students as they worked with content collected in the community to eventually
 upload it to the Lakeland Omeka site.  A backup of that site is present in

      <dd>The Unite the Right rally was a gathering of far-right white nationalist
 groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, on August 11 and 12,
 2017. Those assembled at the rally included members of white
 supremacist, white nationalist, alt-right, neo-Confederate, neo-Nazi, and
 militia movements. The participants were protesting against the removal of
 Confederate monuments and memorials from public spaces, specifically the
 Robert Edward Lee Sculpture in Emancipation Park.
 Hundreds of protesters and counterprotesters were in attendance. There were
 several violent clashes between protesters and counterprotesters. One
 protester plowed a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman and
 injuring 19 other people, including five critically. At least 19 people
 were injured in street brawls and other violence at the rally.
 This bag contains 6,040,247 tweets mentioning 'charlottesville' collected with
 the twarc utility. 5,382,975 were collected from Twitter's streaming API, and
 657,272 from the search API.  The collected tweets range in time from
 2017-08-03 17:16:17 to 2017-08-13 23:24:26 GMT. Data collection began
 2017-08-12 14:17:06 GMT. The log files for both processes are also included.
 Since the keyword 'charlottesville' was trending for several days the
 stream.log file contains information about how many tweets were undelivered.</dd>

 After deployment a problem was discovered in the JavaScript lightroom
 library, which was not able to load the builder and effects library via the
 link to scriptaculous.js.  In addition the high resolution images in the
 archive directory that are loaded by lightroom were missing. This problem was
 fixed by rewriting the scriptaculous links in the items html, and the archive
 files were copied from the backed up files into the static assets. After
 this bit of surgery the zooming images worked as the did originally. This
 bag was then updated with the latest content for the static site.</dd>

      <dd>This bag contains assets related to the www.soweto76archive.org website
 that was created by Angel Nieves and Gregory Lord while they were 
 working with MITH at the University of Maryland. In June 2018 the site
 was archived because it was running a 9 year old version of Wordpress
 that was not compatible with PHP7 which the rest of MITH was upgrading to.
 The server side assets (PHP, media files) and MySQL database was archived
 as wordpress.tar.gz and soweto.sql.gz. The site was then crawled with
 wget to create a static site as well as a WARC file. The specific wget
 command can be found in https://github.com/edsu/bagweb The resulting
 static site was put in place of the Wordpress site, which was 
 decommisioned and sent to Nieves and Lord.</dd>

 http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts
 MITH was able to obtain a spreadsheet (Muffin Files.xlsx) which contains
 the identifiers for each funded project. A program (download.py) was written 
 that downloads the PDF and Excel file for each project and puts it in the
 white-papers directory. In addition a file data.csv is included which is
 the combination of all the Excel files as a CSV.</dd>

      <dd>This is a collection of tweets related to the 2016 US presidential election, 
 collected over the period of July 13, 2016 to November 10, 2016 by George
 Washington University. GWU made the collection available as a tweet 
 identifier dataset, which was then hydrated at the University of Maryland
 over the period of December 1, 2016 and January 2, 2017 using the twarc
 utility.
 The original dataset contained 270,189,978 unique twitter identifiers of which 
 237,651,319 were hydrated (88%). This bag contains the ids that were used 
 for hydration in the ids directory, and the hydrated tweets in the tweets
 directory. Each id file has a corresponding README that explains how the 
 dataset was created, including what keywords were used to created it.

      <dd>This bag contains 32,056 tweets that mention "ferguson" between 
 August 8 and August 10, 2014. They were collected on May 7th, 2015
 using a script that collected Twitter identifiers from the search
 form on Twitter's website:
     https://github.com/edsu/twarc/blob/master/utils/discover_ids.py
 The identifiers were then rehydrated using twarc's --hydrate option.
 Some important ramifications to be aware of is that the dataset does
 not include tweets that were deleted before May 7th, 2015 ; and retweets
 are not included.
 This datset augments another tweet collection (mith-bag 
 fe28a093-d3f4-42d7-83ba-f5ba1b1cc765) which has a more complete snapshot
 but is missing tweets just after the killing of Michael Brown on

 Manager (m5_003). The directory path that SFM stored twitter data was
 archived and compressed as data/tweets.tar.gz.
 You will notice on unarchiving that that the archive includes many individual
 tweet files organized into a directory tree by year, month, day, hour. Each
 file usually contains 15 minutes of tweets. These files are usually gzip
 compressed but you will notice that there are a few that are not. You will
 also notice that a small number of files were not close correctly so you get
 an error like "unexpected end of file" on reading the end of the file.</dd>
